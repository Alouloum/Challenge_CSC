## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify the presence or absence of specific sub-events in tweets posted during football matches from the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups. Using annotated datasets, we aim to build an accurate binary classification model capable of predicting in-game sub-events based on tweet content.

**Sub-events Include:**
- Full Time
- Goal
- Half Time
- Kick Off
- Other
- Own Goal
- Penalty
- Red Card
- Yellow Card
